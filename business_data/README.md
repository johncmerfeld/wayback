# Data on Massachusetts businesses gathered from [recommendedcompany.com](http://www.recommendedcompany.com)

**Notes**:

  - This dataset is not final yet -- I killed the scraper before it was quite done but there are also a fair number of duplicates. 
  - I do not know how this website was put together and cannot independantly verify that it represents an accurate list of businesses.
  - That said, hopefully it serves as a decent stepping stone for matching business names to their location and industry. I used fine-grained categories in this document, but in a subsequent scrape I can include broader groupings too.
